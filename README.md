# Xoluin (XOLN)

**Xoluin** — PoW‑cryptocurrency *tail emission* (mining forever) and K12 + memory‑hard algo.

- Ticker: **XOLN**
- Block time: **60s**
- Reward: **12.5 XOLN**, halving every 4 years; tail: **0.5 XOLN/block forever**
- Status: **WIP / Testnet soon**

## Repo
- `xoluin-core` — node
- `xoluin-miner` — miner
- `xoluin-tools` — CLI-tools

## Why tail emission?
After emission is exhausted, many networks rely solely on transaction fees, which can reduce hashrate. Tail emission provides perpetual miner incentives with minimal inflation.

## Tokenomics (Preliminary)

The current proposed token emission model for Xoluin is:

- **Total Premine**: 10% of total supply  
  - Allocated to development and community funds  
  - **Vesting**: linear over 24 months  
  - Held on a public multisig address with transparent tracking

- **Developer Fee**: 2% of block rewards  
  - Active for the first **2 years** after mainnet launch  
  - Automatically disabled after that

- **Tail Emission**: 0.5 XOLN per block — forever  
  - Keeps miners incentivized after halvings

- **Block reward at launch**: 12.5 XOLN  
  - Halving every 4 years

⛓️ These parameters are **subject to discussion** and will be finalized based on feedback from testnet participants and the wider community.
